# Basic Project Info

### Project Title
cros-map: learning AD signatures in aging and ~cross-mapping~ them to development

### Brief Project Description
ROS/MAP is a dataset of >1000 healthy and congitively impaired individuals with structural and functional neuroimaging data. A handful also have postmortem neuropathology data. We will use this data to derive autopsy-validated imaging signatures of vulnerability and resilience to neurodegenerative pathology. We will then examine these signatures in a neurodevelopment cohort (RBC) and test whether factors such as SES and education influence the development of regions that later confer resilience or vulnerability to brain pathology.
